##Description:

As a group of fellow indecisive team members, we wanted to create an application that easily generated a date night idea by the click of a button. A lot of couples often experience indecisiveness when choosing a movie to watch or a meal to eat, sometimes never coming to an agreement. With our webpage, we wanted to build something both functional and usable to help the indecisive couples finally find a meal to make as well as dinner to watch. With our random recipe and movie generator buttons, you can generate multiple meals and recipes with just a simple click of a button. Not only that, but you can save a recipe or movie for later that maybe you loved, or simply want to come back to. We found our finished project is a simple, refined webpage that is very easy to navigate. We learned to effectively communicate and collaborate using Github and teamwork. We used Bulma to style our webpage, which was at first difficult to grasp but quickly made an appealing design. We ran into some trouble with the save for later buttons and using local storage to display our saved favorites onto the page. We all learned a lot about problem solving with a team as well as API’s and LocalStorage.
